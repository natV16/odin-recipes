    <h5>Bring the Middle Eastern sweets counter to your home with Michael Rantissi's pecan baklava rolls.</h5>
    <p>Baklava, baklava, baklava! It’s such an amazingly perfect dessert, but it’s often time-consuming to make. I’m so nuts (pun intended!) about baklava that I made a simpler, rolled variation that you can make much quicker.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>300g pecans, finely crushed but not powdery, plus 100g extra to garnish</li>
        <li>1 1/ 2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>20 sheets fresh filo pastry</li>
        <li>400g ghee, melted, cooled</li>
        <li>500g caster sugar</li>
        <li>60g glucose syrup</li>
        <li>2 cinnamon quills</li>
        <li>2 tbs lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Intructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 150°C. For the syrup, place all ingredients and 300ml water in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to the boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring, for 3-5 minutes until slightly thickened. Remove from heat and cool.</li>
        <li>Place crushed pecan in a bowl with the spices and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>As filo pastry dries out quickly, it is best to work with a few sheets at a time and then cover the rest with a lightly damp tea towel until ready to use. Brush a sheet of filo with ghee, then sprinkle about 2 tbs of nut and spice mixture on top. Layer with another sheet of filo, brush with ghee and sprinkle over 2 tbs nut mixture. Repeat this process until you have layered 5 sheets of filo with nut and spice mixture. Roll filo into a long log lengthways. Make sure that the roll is not too loose or too tight. Repeat until you have made 4 logs.</li>
        <li>Cut each log into 2.5cm-wide rounds. Arrange pieces close together with cut sides facing up in a large baking tray with high sides. Bake for 1 hour or until golden brown. Pour the cooled syrup over the hot baklava and let it rest. Sprinkle over extra crushed pecans to garnish.</li>
    </ol>
