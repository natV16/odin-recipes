    <h5>A healthy fall or winter appetizer - great for Thanksgiving, the holidays, or just for snacking! Vegetarian, vegan and gluten free.</h5>
    <p>I hope you need a last-minute Thanksgiving appetizer because this butternut squash hummus dip is so insanely good! While I was making it, I couldn’t stop eating it. Now that the leftovers are in the fridge, I can’t walk by the kitchen without grabbing a cracker for a quick swipe.</p>
    <p>It’s easy to make, especially if you’re roasting butternut squash for another recipe – just roast an extra cup of cubed squash and swirl this hummus together in no time. It’s thick, creamy, tangy, and nicely spiced from the cumin, coriander, and a bit of cayenne.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup cubed butternut squash (½ inch cubes)</li>
        <li>1 large or 2 medium garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1½ cups cooked chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>¼ cup tahini</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon coriander</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cayenne, less if sensitive to spice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sea salt, plus more for sprinkling</li>
        <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
        <li>¼ cup water, or as needed</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>For Toppings & Serving</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup POM POMS pomegranate arils</li>
        <li>¼ cup feta cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped parsley</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons microgreens, optional</li>
        <li>drizzle of olive oil</li>
        <li>pita, crackers and/or veggies</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the squash on the baking sheet and toss with a drizzle of olive oil and a few pinches of salt and pepper. Wrap the garlic cloves in foil with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and place on the baking sheet. Roast for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the squash is tender. Let cool slightly.</li>
        <li>In a food processor, combine the roasted squash, roasted peeled garlic, chickpeas, tahini, lemon juice, cumin, coriander, cayenne, and sea salt.</li>
        <li>With the blade running, drizzle in the olive oil. Add water, as need, to blend to a smooth consistency. Taste and adjust seasonings. (Note: this is a bit spicy before you add the olive oil - the olive oil tones down the spice.)</li>
        <li>Scoop the hummus into a serving bowl and top with pomegranate arils, feta, parsley, microgreens, if using, and a drizzle of olive oil. Serve with toasted pita, crackers, and/or chopped veggies.</li>
    </ol>
